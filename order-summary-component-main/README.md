## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was super simple, which I guess is a good sign.

### Useful resources

No special resources or sites this time around. I did play around with the blue button box shadow a bit. I think it
looks ok, and pretty close to the design file.
