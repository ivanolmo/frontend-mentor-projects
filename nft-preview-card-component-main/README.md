## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I can easily center a card in a page with 3 lines of Flexbox... who knew:

```css
body {
  display: flexbox;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Also, setting a font size (even the very popular 62.5%) in the html element isn't necessary. For this project, I just assumed 1 rem = 16px, and sized everything from there.

### Useful resources

The Frontend Mentor community. I received some good feedback on my first project, and put it to use in this one. It definitely helped.
