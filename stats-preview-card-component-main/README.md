## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was another simple project. I only had a bit of trouble with the tinted image. I learned about mix-blend-mode and put it to use.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - Learned a new (to me) technique to blend an image with it's parents background, i.e. mix-blend-mode.
