### What I learned

Centering things can still be a challenge sometimes ðŸ˜‚ Also, this was my first time using a Figma design. I think I love it. Overall, this was pretty simple, and a good start.

### Useful resources

- [Figma Docs](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956974-Measure-distances-between-layers) - Since this was my first time using Figma, I had to learn the basics. Specifically, measuring distances to get this simple design pixel perfect. The docs were great.
