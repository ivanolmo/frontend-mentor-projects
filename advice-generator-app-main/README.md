## My process

### Built with

This was a pretty simple project that used calls to the Advice Slip API. I utilized async functions to fetch data, then update the UI on each button click.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) - Just a quick refresher on async functions.
