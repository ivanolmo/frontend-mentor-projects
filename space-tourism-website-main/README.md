## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that there is A TON to accessibility if it's done right. I checked out Kevin Powell's version of this project on Scrimba, and he definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CSS and accessibility. While I only incorporated a few of his suggestions, I learned a bunch of stuff that I'll use in future projects.

### Continued development

I love space, so adding more data to this project would be fun. NASA has some cool open APIs available, so this might be one I actually follow up on in the future ðŸ˜Ž

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co) - Kevin definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CSS and making things accessible. He's a great resource.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN for literally anything you need to know, especially with the variety of Flex/Grid placement properties.
