## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the CSS `clamp()` function for the first time in this project. Looking back, it's all over my stylesheet, but I'll probably change the way I use it moving forward.

In this project it's used for `font-size`, `margin`, `max-width`, and image/`background-image` sizing. It became
tedious to manage, especially with media queries. I think I'll only use it on `font-size` for now.

### Continued development

It'd be nice to clean up my media queries, because there's a little repetition in there. My CSS formatting
could probably be improved.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - MDN, specifically the pages about `background-image`
  position/size, and of course the `clamp()` page.
- [CSS-Tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) - This specific CSS-Tricks page is all about `clamp()`, and it has a great calculator to figure out your middle values. It was pretty accurate.
